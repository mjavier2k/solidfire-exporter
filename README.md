# NetApp Solidfire Exporter

![Go](https://github.com/mjavier2k/solidfire-exporter/workflows/Go/badge.svg?event=push)

NetApp Solidfire-Exporter queries the Solidfire API and exports the results as Prometheus metrics

Implementation is based on [Solidfire 11.3 API](https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2856155)

There are two different options to configure the solidfire-exporter

1) Using environment variables. These option takes precedence if config.yaml is also specified.

#### Shell-Like Environments

Note that we *are* allowed to double-quote the values here

```bash
export SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_USERNAME="mySolidfireUsername"
export SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_PASSWORD="mySolidfirePassword"
export SOLIDFIRE_LISTEN_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:9987"
export SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_ENDPOINT="https://10.10.10.10/json-rpc/11.3"
export SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_INSECURE=true
export SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=30
```
#### Docker-Type Environments / SystemD EnvironmentFile Environment

Note that we **MAY NOT** have any double quotes in the values below!

```bash
SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_USERNAME=mySolidfireUsername
SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_PASSWORD=mySolidfirePassword
SOLIDFIRE_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:9987
SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_ENDPOINT=https://10.10.10.10/json-rpc/11.3
SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_INSECURE=true
SOLIDFIRE_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=30
```

2) Using config.yaml

```
listen:
  address: 127.0.0.1:9987
client:
  endpoint: https://192.168.1.2/json-rpc/11.3
  username: mySolidfireUsername
  password: mySolidfirePassword
  insecure: false
  timeout: 130
```

### Prometheus Configuration

```
- job_name: solidfire_exporter
  honor_timestamps: true
  scrape_interval: 30s
  scrape_timeout: 20s
  metrics_path: /metrics
  scheme: http
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - localhost:9987
    labels:
      app: solidfire-exporter
      group: prometheus
      sfcluster: sfcluster01
```

### Using Docker

Create an file with the environment variables set and pass it to docker run. 

```
docker run --env-file=.env_file  --rm -p 8080:8080 mjavier/solidfire-exporter:latest
```
